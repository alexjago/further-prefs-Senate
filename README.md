# Senate Further-Preference Analysis

A script to analyse n-party-preferred further preferences on ballots with a given first preference, using the AEC's 2016-format formal-ballot data.

## Requirements

- A working Python 3 install, preferably 3.5 or better. 


### Preference distribution

- The full preference CSV for your selected State or Territory. The Queensland one was last seen [here](http://results.aec.gov.au/20499/Website/External/aec-senate-formalpreferences-20499-QLD.zip) and is about 550MB after decompression. 

- Knowledge of how ballot numbers are assigned to candidates and tickets if you want to set up your own distributions. (`SenateCandidatesBallotNumbers.ods` should be of assistance.)
